Problem-Many households in urban areas consume large amounts of energy, leading to high energy bills and environmental damage. However, many residents may not be aware of their energy consumption patterns or have the knowledge to reduce their energy usage.  
This problem can be addressed by developing a web application that identifies households with high energy consumption, provides personalized guidance for reducing energy usage, and offers information on renewable energy sources. 

Solution- Our web application will use monthly energy consumption data to identify households with high energy consumption in each area. It will then assign mentors to provide personalized guidance and support for reducing energy usage. Additionally, the application will offer information on renewable energy sources such as solar panels and provide monthly energy consumption predictions to help households plan and monitor their energy usage.
